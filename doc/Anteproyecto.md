### Description <a name="Description"></a> of the problem.

A well-known recognized brand wants to have a database that contains information about the product, price, origin, recipients, quantity, the purchase and sale of its products in the vending machines. The data to take into account are:

1. The range of the product: each product will have a quality that gives them more or less value when buying or selling

2. Price: Not all products have the same price, it will depend on their quality and demand (greater demand, more expensive and vice versa).

3. Origin: It means that each product comes from a different supplier, it can raise or lower the price or quality of the product.

4. Recipients: The products will be aimed at regular buyers and new buyers (I would like to add something like, free sample to capture more sales on the same buyer)

5. Quantity: All products have a stock, and to increase and decrease the price the brand reserves the right to play with the stock by putting less stock of the same product to raise its price or raising the stock to lower its price.

6. Sale: The machine will inform the seller of the stock and the purchase price of the product, as well as refuse to receive more of the product that the seller wants to sell. Each product purchased by the vending machine will have its own code

### Aim.

The objective would be to make a vending machine, in which we can buy a product, replace the money in the machine, replace the stock of a product and change the price of a product.
